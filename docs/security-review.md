# Security Code Review

This document contains the findings and recommendations from a security code review of the Nexus LARP site.

## Overview

The Nexus LARP site has implemented several security measures to protect against common web application vulnerabilities. This review examines the current security implementations and identifies areas for improvement.

## Current Security Implementations

The following security measures are already in place:

1. **Secure Storage of Sensitive Information**
   - Environment variables are used for storing sensitive information
   - A `.env.example` file is provided to document required environment variables
   - Docker build arguments are used to pass environment variables during the build process

2. **Auth0 Implementation**
   - Auth0 is used for authentication and authorization
   - Proper scopes and permissions are configured
   - CSRF protection is enabled for Auth0 transactions

3. **CSRF Protection**
   - Double Submit Cookie pattern is implemented
   - CSRF tokens are included in all non-GET API requests
   - CSRF validation is performed on both client and server sides

4. **Error Handling**
   - Centralized error handling utility prevents information leakage
   - User-friendly error messages are provided
   - Errors are logged safely without exposing sensitive information

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Client-side rate limiting is implemented for API requests
   - Different rate limits are configured for different endpoints
   - User-friendly error messages are provided when rate limits are exceeded

6. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - DOMPurify is used for HTML sanitization
   - Input validation is performed on both client and server sides
   - Form inputs are validated using React Hook Form

7. **Security Logging**
   - Security events are logged with appropriate severity levels
   - Different types of security events are categorized
   - Sensitive information is redacted from logs

8. **Content Security Policy**
   - CSP headers are configured in the nginx configuration
   - Strict CSP rules are applied to prevent XSS attacks
   - Additional security headers are included (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Security Concerns and Recommendations

Despite the strong security measures already in place, the following concerns and recommendations were identified:

1. **Dependency Management**
   - **Concern**: There is no automated dependency scanning or vulnerability checking in the CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement automated dependency scanning using tools like npm audit, Snyk, or Dependabot. Add a step in the CI/CD pipeline to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

2. **Docker Security**
   - **Concern**: The Dockerfile uses the `latest` tag for the nginx image, which could lead to unexpected changes.
   - **Recommendation**: Pin the nginx image to a specific version (e.g., `nginx:1.25.3-alpine`) to ensure consistency and security.
   
   - **Concern**: The container runs as the default nginx user, which has more privileges than necessary.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a `USER` directive to the Dockerfile to run the container as a non-root user with minimal privileges.

3. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - **Concern**: The nginx configuration listens on port 80 (HTTP) without explicit HTTPS configuration.
   - **Recommendation**: Configure nginx to listen on port 443 (HTTPS) and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. If HTTPS is handled by a load balancer or reverse proxy, document this in the README.

4. **Build Configuration**
   - **Concern**: The Vite build is configured with `minify: false`, which could expose more information than necessary.
   - **Recommendation**: Enable minification for production builds to reduce the amount of information exposed in the client-side code.
   
   - **Concern**: The Grafana Faro API key is hardcoded in the vite.config.js file.
   - **Recommendation**: Move the API key to an environment variable and inject it during the build process.

5. **Regular Security Audits**
   - **Concern**: There is no documented process for regular security audits or penetration testing.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement a regular schedule for security audits and penetration testing. Document the process and findings.

6. **Security Documentation**
   - **Concern**: While there is good documentation for individual security features, there is no comprehensive security documentation.
   - **Recommendation**: Create a comprehensive security documentation that covers all security features, configurations, and best practices for developers.

## Conclusion

The Nexus LARP site has implemented several strong security measures to protect against common web application vulnerabilities. By addressing the concerns and implementing the recommendations outlined in this review, the security posture of the application can be further improved.

## Next Steps

1. Implement automated dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
2. Update the Dockerfile to use a specific nginx version and run as a non-root user
3. Configure HTTPS or document the existing HTTPS configuration
4. Enable minification for production builds and move the Grafana Faro API key to an environment variable
5. Implement a regular schedule for security audits and penetration testing
6. Create comprehensive security documentation
