# NEXUS LARP Site Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the NEXUS LARP site. Tasks are organized by category and include both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture and Code Organization

1. [x] Refactor App.jsx from class component to functional component with hooks for consistency with the rest of the codebase
2. [x] Implement a state management solution (Redux Toolkit or Zustand) to replace the complex prop drilling and state management
3. [ ] Create a standardized API client with error handling and request/response interceptors
4. [ ] Implement a proper routing system with route guards and lazy loading
5. [ ] Separate business logic from UI components using custom hooks and services
6. [ ] Standardize component folder structure (e.g., component/index.jsx, component/styles.scss, component/hooks.js)
7. [ ] Create reusable UI component library with storybook documentation
8. [ ] Implement proper TypeScript support throughout the application
9. [ ] Create environment-specific configuration files (.env.development, .env.production)
10. [ ] Refactor CSS to use a more maintainable approach (CSS modules, styled-components, or Tailwind)

## Performance Optimization

11. [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading for routes

19. [ ] Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
20. [ ] Add prefetching for critical resources

## Testing

21. [x] Set up a testing framework (Jest, Vitest, or React Testing Library)
22. [x] Implement unit tests for utility functions
23. [x] Add component tests for critical UI components
24. [x] Implement integration tests for key user flows
25. [x] Add end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright
26. [x] Set up test coverage reporting
27. [ ] Implement visual regression testing
28. [ ] Add accessibility testing with axe or similar tools
29. [ ] Create mock services for API testing
30. [x] Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline

## Documentation

31. [ ] Create comprehensive README with project overview, setup instructions, and architecture
32. [ ] Document API endpoints and data models
33. [ ] Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
34. [ ] Create developer onboarding guide
35. [ ] Document state management approach and data flow
36. [ ] Create user documentation for key features
37. [ ] Document build and deployment process
38. [ ] Create architecture diagrams
39. [x] Document testing strategy and approach
40. [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic

## Accessibility

41. [ ] Perform accessibility audit with automated tools
42. [ ] Ensure proper semantic HTML throughout the application

## Security

51. [x] Implement proper CSRF protection
52. [x] Add Content Security Policy (CSP)
53. [x] Secure Auth0 implementation with proper scopes and permissions
54. [x] Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
55. [x] Add rate limiting for API requests
56. [x] Implement proper input validation and sanitization
57. [x] Secure storage of sensitive information
58. [x] Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
59. [x] Implement proper logging for security events
